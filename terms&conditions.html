        <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
        <p>It is not necessary for any Client to have signed an acceptance of these terms and conditions for them to apply. If a Client accepts a quote then the Client will be deemed to have satisfied themselves as to the terms applying and have accepted these terms and conditions in full.
            <br/>
                Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Any purchase or use of our services implies that you have read and accepted our terms and conditions.</p>
            
                <h2>2. Charges</h2>
                <p>Charges for services to be provided by <strong>Lucignation Tech</strong> are defined in the project quotation that the Client receives via e-mail. Quotations are valid for a period of 30 days. <Strong>Lucignation Tech</Strong> reserves the right to alter or decline to provide a quotation after expiry of the 30 days.

                        Unless agreed otherwise with the Client, all website design services require an advance payment of a minimum of thirty three (33) percent of the project quotation total before the work is supplied to the Client for review. A second charge of thirty three (33) percent is required after the development stage, with the remaining thirty three (33) percent of the project quotation total due upon completion of the work, prior to upload to the server or release of materials.
                        </p>  
                        
                <h2>3. Client Review</h2>

                <p><strong>Lucignation Tech</strong> will provide the Client with an opportunity to review the appearance and content of the website during the design phase and once the overall website development is completed. At the completion of the project, such materials will be deemed to be accepted and approved unless the Client notifies <strong>Lucignation Tech</strong> otherwise within ten (10) days of the date the materials are made available to the Client.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Turnaround Time and Content Control</h2>
<strong>Lucignation Tech</strong> will install and publicly post or supply the Client's website by the date specified in the project proposal, or at date agreed with Client upon <strong>Lucignation Tech</strong> receiving initial payment, unless a delay is specifically requested by the Client and agreed by <strong>Lucignation Tech</strong>.

                        In return, the Client agrees to delegate a single individual as a primary contact to aid <strong>Lucignation Tech</strong>

                        <p><strong>Lucignation Tech</strong> is a small business, to remain efficient we must ensure that work we have programmed is carried out at the scheduled time. On occasions we may have to reject offers for other work and enquiries to ensure that your work is completed at the time arranged.

                                This is why we ask that you provide all the required information in advance. On any occasion where progress cannot be made with your website because we have not been given the required information in the agreed time frame, and we are delayed as result, we reserve the right to impose a surcharge of up to 25%. If your project involves Search Engine Optimisation we need the text content for your site in advance so that the SEO can be planned and completed efficiently.
                                
                                If you agree to provide us with the required information and subsequently fail to do within one week of project commencement we reserve the right to close the project and the balance remaining becomes payable immediately. Simply put, all the above condition says is do not give us the go ahead to start until you are ready to do so.
